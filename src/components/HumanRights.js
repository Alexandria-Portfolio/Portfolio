        Worked on a cross-functional team of 7 to improve upon a web application
        for Human Rights First. We developed improvements for a visualization
        that showcases incidents of police use of force in the United States.

      <p>
        I worked with a team of data scientists to implement a model that would
        classify the potential incidents where types of force were used and add
        them to a database to be visualized by the application. I tested the
        previous API implementation and optimized the previous database based on
        the testing.
